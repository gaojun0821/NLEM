# NLEM
Robust Needle localization and enhancement

The proposed NLEM method consists of three steps,namely beam steering,multi-task learning(MTL) network,and needle fusion framework.
The MTL network of step 2 is the key component of the proposed NLEM method. This project mainly includes the source codes and well-trained model of the MTL network, as well as some examples of segmentation results.
